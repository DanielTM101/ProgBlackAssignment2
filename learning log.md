Optiver Ready Trader Go - Daniel Adesanya, Victory Hicks & Karlton Charles

I have gained knowledge about the value of liquidity and the distinctions between liquid and illiquid assets in financial markets as a participant in the Optiver Ready Trader Go competition. I learned the fundamentals of financial markets through the competition, including how market makers contribute to liquidity and maintain market efficiency.

I also gained knowledge of the many categories of market players, including traders, institutional investors, and individual investors. Learning about the tactics employed by market makers and how they continuously buy and sell stocks to maintain market liquidity was fascinating.

During the competition, I became familiar with exchanges and order books, which are used to match buy and sell orders in financial markets. I learned how traders interact with these order books and how they use them to execute trades. I also learned that illiquid assets, such as certain stocks and bonds, can be more challenging to trade and may have wider bid-ask spreads, making them riskier investments.

One trading strategy that particularly caught my attention was pairs trading. It's a market-neutral trading strategy that involves buying and selling two highly correlated financial instruments simultaneously. I found this strategy to be interesting because it seeks to profit from the difference in price between the two instruments.

To calculate the profitability of a trading strategy, traders often use metrics such as the profit-and-loss statement, which shows the profits and losses of a trading strategy over a certain period. It's essential to understand these metrics to determine if a trading strategy is profitable or not.

Building a competitive algorithm requires a good understanding of the financial markets and trading strategies. Throughout the competition, I developed my algorithm using machine learning techniques to identify patterns in market data and technical analysis to identify potential trading opportunities. I also tested my algorithm extensively before deploying it in the live markets.

In conclusion, participating in the Optiver Ready Trader Go competition has been a great learning experience. I have gained a better understanding of the financial markets, including the importance of liquidity and the differences between liquid and illiquid assets, as well as trading strategies and metrics used to measure profitability. I look forward to applying this knowledge in my future trading endeavors.
